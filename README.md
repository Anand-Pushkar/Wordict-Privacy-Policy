The app does not collect or share any sensitive data of the user. The app does however ask for the user's first name but it is stored in the user's device itself.
The user's name never leaves the user's device, there is no transaction of any sensitive data outside the app.
The app caches data inside the user's device. The data cache can be removed from the device if the user wishes for it.
